  Auto complete framework with a spell checker included. based on the added words.
  The APIs are in auto_complete.h and the library is libautocomplete.a which also includes the spell_check routine.
  To test: compile with: "make"
  RUN as: ./auto_complete wordlist.txt <spell_check_word_list_separated_by_spaces>

  Changes/comments for improvement are welcome.
